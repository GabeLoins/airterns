Hi I'm Nathan! I am incredibly excited to be working on the API team this summer. I will hopefully get to play with some iOS code too if I have the time, since mobile dev is a pretty big interest of mine. I'll be living a block from Dolores Park for most of the summer (come visit!), and am traveling to Israel for two weeks during June! I'm sad to miss Airbnb for those couple weeks but it should be a blast. I'm a CS major at Stanford going into my Junior year, and will be studying abroad in Berlin next fall. Super stoked for life these next several months :) Really excited to meet you all!
