Hey! I'm Nicolas and I will be an intern on the iOS Team this summer! I'm really into iOS, web and security, but like to mess around with every piece of tech I can get my hands on. Other than that, I love music, song-writing and production. Hanging out is cool. Local shows are great. Food is awesome. Coffee is essential. Can't wait to meet you all!
