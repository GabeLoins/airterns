Hi! My name is Alex and I will be your the Engineering Intern coordinator for the summer. I went to a new, tiny engineering college you have never heard of called Olin College of Engineering. I'll be helping making sure that everyone is getting what they want out of the experience and learning a ton. It's literally my job to make sure you guys have a wildly successful internship at Airbnb. When I'm not writing android apps, I enjoy motorcycles, tennis, and glassblowing.
