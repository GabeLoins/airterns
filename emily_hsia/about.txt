Hi! I'm Emily and I'm currently a junior studying CS at Columbia University, and I'm super excited to be joining the Host team this summer. On the technical side, I really enjoy web/mobile development, and I also like nerdy stuff like compilers and computer architecture. When I'm not programming, you could probably find me running/walking my dog, at a concert, checking out a museum exhibit, or reading random Wikipedia articles. Good luck on the rest of your semesters, and I can't wait to meet you all soon!
