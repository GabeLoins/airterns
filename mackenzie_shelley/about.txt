Hi everyone! I'm Mackenzie (but you can call me Kenz if that's too many
syllables). I'll be a senior at the University of Michigan in the fall (Go
Blue!). I'm super excited to be interning on the Trust and Safety team! Outside
of work, I enjoy running, hiking, locating good food/coffee, and chilling with
friends. I can't wait to meet you all soon!
