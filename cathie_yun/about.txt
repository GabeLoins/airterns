Hi, I'm Catherine - call me Cathie! I'm currently a sophomore at MIT studying Computer Science, and I'm excited to be interning on the search team for the summer. I'm interested in data analysis, and have experience in web/android/iOS programming. When I'm not coding, I love exploring the outdoors - rock climbing, running/hiking/backpacking, camping, surfing, you name it! I'm also a hip-hop dancer, traveler, and food fanatic. I can't wait to meet everyone and have an amazing summer at Airbnb!
