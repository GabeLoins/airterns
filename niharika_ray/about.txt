Hi everyone! My name is Niharika, although I go by Nikki :) I'm a junior
CS major at Carnegie Mellon (although I guess now technically I'm a senior
- eep!), with a minor in Computational Finance. I'll be working on the 
Data Science team, and I'm super excited about it since that's a part of 
CS that I've always been interested in. When I'm not coding, you can 
find me debating various legal things - I'm a member of CMU's Mock Trial
Team or finding new places in Pittsburgh to eat. I'm definitely also 
trying to get in shape this summer, so hopefully I'll be able to get 
a ton of rock climbing, running, and aerial yoga (this one might be the 
ambitious one) in. See all of you soon!
