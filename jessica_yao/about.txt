Hey guys! My name is Jessica, and I'm now a senior studying CS at Harvard. I'm really psyched to be on the Trust and Safety team this summer, and am looking forward to learning new things and contributing to Airbnb. Besides programming, some of my other hobbies include jogging, hiking/backpacking, food, and traveling to new places (I feel like there is a really good opportunity to mesh those activities with Airbnb...did someone say road trip?)
