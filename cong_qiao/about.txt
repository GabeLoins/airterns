Hi! My name is Cong Qiao. I am currently a Ph.D. student at Brandeis University, studying computational physics. I’m very excited that I am going to intern on the Payments Team. I’m interested in computer simulation, backend, statistics, web scraping and reverse engineering. When I’m not allowed to code, I enjoy archery, reading and cleaning up my files. I can’t wait to meet everyone and have an amazing summer!
