Hey there,
I'm Rasmus and I'll be working on Payments this summer! I'm stoked to be back at
Airbnb after having a great experience last summer. You'll find me in the corner
with the Payments team or bonding with the marvelous La Marzocco espresso
machine. Such a wonderful piece of equipment. When I'm not obsessing over coffee
or working on my CS masters at Stanford, I enjoy listening to European electronic
music, taking photos and cooking Italian food.
Looking forward to hanging out with all of you this summer!
