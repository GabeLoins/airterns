Hello!

I'm Keziah Plattner (pronounced Keh-ZEE-yah), and I'm super excited to work at 
Airbnb this summer! I'm currently a CS Masters student at Stanford. As a former
undergrad in AI and a current Systems graduate student, I love working on anything 
and everything backend related! I'm looking forward to learning a lot on the
Search team :) 

I'm originally from San Diego, and in my free time I like: anything food
related (especially if it involves dim sum), Netflix, hanging out in coffeeshops 
and Broadway musicals. Can't wait to explore SF with you all this summer!
