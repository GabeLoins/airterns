Hi! My name is Joel, and I'm currently a junior EECS major at UC Berkeley. This summer I'll be working with the Global Supply team, and I'm excited to contribute, learn, and meet a ton of awesome people at Airbnb! Besides coding, I'm a big fan of the outdoors and love running and hiking. However, I'm also a big fan of the indoors where I watch a lot of TV.
